                                                    Unit One Game

                          Hello, My name is Stephen Smith and this is my Tomagotchi Project

                  My game design will be based off the original tomagotchi. The pet will be able to
                  eat, exercise, play, age, and die. The death of the pet will be dependent on the 
                  age of the pet and the amount of food, exercise, and play time it receives.

                  The player will be able to name the pet, and press buttons on the webpage to cause 
                  the pet to eat, play, and exercise. (There may be a sleeping button to rejuvinate the
                  pet). The pet will live up to the age of 6. That means there will be 6 stages to the pet.
                  (Each age will be represented by the color of the pet.) 6 ages will be represented by six colors.
                  The pet will be given a proper burial at the last stage of life. 
                  
                  -- My design changed to a Digimon like tamagotchi design. I found gifs that move and decided to use them as my character.

                                                       User Story
                                  1.   The game starts by pressing the start/hatch button
                                  2.   You have 4 bars - Hunger, Sleep, Play, Age
                                  3.   The Age increases every 5 seconds
                                  4.   If food, boredom, and sleepiness gets to 10, the game ends
                                  5.   If age reaches 10 - you win and the game ends.
                                  6.   A tombstone will end the game.
                                  7.   The digimon will stop evolving when you win.
                                  8. The character will evolve every time the age increases by 2.
